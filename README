NOTE:

This project makes use of a stripped down (and modified by me) version of Emotiv's community SDK 
available here: https://github.com/Emotiv/community-sdk. The borrowed and modified code has also been
included with this repository to assist anyone who wants to use this with ease. I do not own credit
for the aforementioned portion of the code. The SDK license is available at the above link.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:

Software:
	Microsoft Windows 7 64 bit
	MATLAB r2015a for windows 64 bit
	Python 2.7.11
	Emotiv Testbench Suite

Hardware:
	Emotiv EPOC headset
	USB receiver for Emotiv EPOC headset
	Stereo earphones
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEPS TO RUN:

1. Unzip this folder at any location
2. Open MATLAB
3. Navigate to the unzipped project folder
4. Open "app.m" inside MATLAB
5. Run "app.m"
6. Open Emotiv Testbench suite
7. Remove paddings of all the sensors in the headset
8. Soak them in water/saline solution for a minute
9. Plug the paddings back
10. Wear the headset such that the imprint "EPOC" at the back of the headset reads up
11. Ensure all the sensors have good contact with skin.
12. Turn ON the headset
13. Observe the indicator mappings light up in the testbench suite
14. Move the headset a bit and/or adjust individual sensors in order to get atleast 8
	indicators GREEN
15. Once this is achieved, you're good to go ahead with running the MuSense application
16. Put on the earphones
17. On the "app" window, click "start/stop" button
18. Sit back and relax
19. You don't need to keep your eyes open to check the meditation level which pops up
	once the application starts
20. Listen for an audio cue - Once the application begins, you'd hear an instrumental track,
	initially being played in mono. A shift from mono to 3D signifies you've crossed 25%
	meditative state. The goal is to reach 100%
21. Once 25% mark is crossed, the sound being played starts rotating inside the head in
	counterclockwise direction. The direction reverses once 50% mark is crossed; the direction
	reverses again and the sound rotates at a higher pace once 75% mark is crossed.
22. The user can make use of the slider to set the difficulty level. Higher the level, more
	effort on the part of the user is required to elevate the meditation level
23. The user can click on the "start/stop" button again to stop the application
